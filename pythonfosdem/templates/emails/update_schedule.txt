Dear {{ user_name }},

We changed the schedule of the Python-FOSDEM devroom because the FOSDEM opens
the doors at 9am and not 8am.

In this case, we have shifted the schedule of one hour.

Here is the schedule of your talk(s):

{%- endtrans -%}
{% for talk in talks %}
* {{ talk.schedule }} : {{ talk.name }}
{%- endfor %}

{% endblock %}
