Dear {{ user_name }},

The selection for the schedule of the Python Devrom @ FOSDEM 2014 [1]
has been very hard.

Your talk "{{ talk_name }}" [2] has been selected as a Backup.

A backup talk is needed if there is a missing speaker. In this case, your talk
should be available for the Python @ FOSDEM 2014 [1].

We still have a few questions:

1. Do you agree ?

2. Could you confirm your talk before 10th January 2014 ?

3. Could you send us your talk one week before the FOSDEM [3] ?
   We want to have the best experience for the speaker without any problem with the beamer.

For this edition, we will follow the same Code of Conduct as the PyCon US [4]

Best regards,
