Dear {{ user_name }},

Please, could you create a user account on Pentabarf.
Pentabarf is the tool used by the FOSDEM for the registration
of the speakers and the talks.

https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/

It's a big change for this edition.

Once done, please, could you inform us ?

Without that we cannot publish the schedule of the Python devroom :/

Really sorry for the inconvenience.

Thank you so much,
{% endtrans %}
